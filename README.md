Dataset 1: Classification
The dataset, called FARS, is a collection of statistics of US road traffic accidents. The class label (target variable) is about the severity of the accident. It has 20 features and over 100K examples. The dataset is available in Canvas as a CSV file, in which the last column contains the class labels: https://ncl.instructure.com/courses/59112/modules/items/3547579

What you need to do:
You will need to perform the following steps on the dataset:

EDA
Data normalisation
Split the data into training and test sets using cross-validation
Develop two machine learning pipelines for classifying the severity of the accident
Present the results for your pipeline using the most appropriate set of metrics.
Provide a short report on which approaches you used and which gave the best results. It would be good to consider why particular pipelines gave the best results.
